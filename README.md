## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Igor.

I'm eager to pursue a career in technology consulting, bringing a strong background as a BI analyst and sales professional at Bradesco Financiamentos and Oracle. With degrees in Business Administration and Computer Science, I possess advanced skills in data engineering (dbt, SQL, Alteryx, Redshift) and beginner proficiency in Java application development. Fluent in English and experienced in cloud computing, I combine technical expertise with business acumen to deliver data-driven solutions.
